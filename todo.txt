M1: CPU renderer (Canvas2D) with smooth coloring.

M2: WebGL2 renderer matching CPU; palette slider; resize handling.

M3: Panning + scroll-to-cursor zoom; progressive render; adaptive iterations.

M4: Double-double math path (proof of concept).

M5: Perturbation deep-zoom path with rebasing; hit 1e-20 scale.
